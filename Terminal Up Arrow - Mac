in .zshrc for zsh
You had up-line-or-search bound to your up-arrow. This should do what you want:

bindkey '^[[A' up-line-or-search
bindkey '^[[B' down-line-or-search

Note :: The command above only uses the first word to search. The following will use the whole line. See man zshcontrib...

autoload -U up-line-or-beginning-search
autoload -U down-line-or-beginning-search
zle -N up-line-or-beginning-search
zle -N down-line-or-beginning-search
bindkey "^[[A" up-line-or-beginning-search # Up
bindkey "^[[B" down-line-or-beginning-search # Down
